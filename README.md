# PS4-Store
This is designed for PS4's Web Browser
index.html contains a converter that switches "store.playstation.com" link to a PS4 Store link, using javascript and HTML.

test1.html is a joke page I used that activates a timer upon clicking an image and then has a link directed to
Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" Rockband 4 DLC.
